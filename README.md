# Document Scanner with OCR

This is a Python application that simulates a simple document scanner using a webcam or static images. The tool allows you to select and correct the perspective of a document, apply filters, and extract text using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) with Tesseract.

The interface is built using Tkinter, and the image processing is powered by OpenCV and Pillow.
